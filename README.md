# isn-project

This is the repository for my first project ever on Github, the building of a website. I created this website back in high school, and didn't knew how to use Github back in the days. So to clean up all things, I moved this project to here.

You will not find a lot of materials here, but if you're curious the website is hosted on<a href="https://soladev.github.io/isn-project">Github Pages<a>

Have a good day !
